		<p>
		My name is Hadas, married to Adir and mother of Kerem, and I live in Tekoa.<br/>
Ever since I can remember, I loved to play with art, colors, and patterns; 
different materials have always pushed me to be creative.
I feel creative expression and excitement with every new collection I design.<br/>
<!--  It excites me to see and experience the process that starts with an idea and inspiration - a process in which a unique and beautiful physical collection is created. -->
<!-- The sources of inspiration that change with each collection allow me to provide you with a sense of diversity. You can feel  special while expressing a unique and artistic statement when wearing my jewelry.  -->

<!-- The lines that guide and intrigue me in design are the connection between materials, such as hard materials against soft, and metals combined with fabrics. -->
<!-- These contrasting combinations of materials create harmony and contain the contradictions that make up our lives. -->

My business began nine years ago when I used to make my own jewelry. Over time, the demand increased, the amount of customers and employees grew, and the business developed.
Today the jewelry can be found here on the website, at my studio in Tekoa, on the international online store ETSY, in designer stores, and at artist fairs across the country.<br/>

Another thing that is important to me to share with you is that the manufacture of the jewelry is done in collaboration with rehabilitated mental health patients at the protected factory "Derech Ha'omanot". I believe that creativity, nationalism and employment have an ability to heal.<br/>


"Realize your dreams and be creative, you are unique in the world.”<br/>

I hope you enjoy the jewelry, and that it will bring you light and joy.
